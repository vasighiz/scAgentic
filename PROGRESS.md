# scAgentic Development Progress

## Day 1 (Current Status)

### LLM Integration Status
The app currently uses a local LLM (Mistral via Ollama) for processing natural language queries about single-cell data, with functions like `process_query_with_llm()` that interpret user questions and map them to specific analysis functions, but this feature is not yet fully implemented as indicated by the ‚òê AI Copilot status in the README.

### Current Technologies Used

#### Core Technologies
- **Streamlit**: Used for building the interactive web interface
- **Scanpy**: Core library for single-cell RNA-seq analysis
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical computations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization and plotting

#### LLM Integration
- Currently using Ollama with Mistral model directly (not using LangChain)
- Custom implementation of query processing and response generation
- Basic prompt engineering and function mapping

### Missing Technologies
- LangChain is not included yet
- No vector database for semantic search
- No proper memory management for chat history
- No proper tool/function calling framework

### Next Steps
1. Implement proper LLM integration using LangChain
2. Add vector database for semantic search
3. Implement proper memory management
4. Set up tool/function calling framework
5. Enhance prompt engineering
6. Add proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
